						<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>I had some issues getting my buttons to work the way I wanted them too. 
							They were able to change the css code, but would add a weird highlight around the text instead
							of changing the color of the entire box. I looked through my code for sometime, but after a few hours
							I realized the problem was in my HTMl code as I didn't include the class and id of the div in one line and instead
							gave them their own individual divs. After fixing this, I had no other issues with the main tasks. Another
							problem we came across was figuring out the bonus task, We were able to make 3 buttons, only one functional, that 
							would change the css of all 3 boxes at once, but after 2 hours we just decided to turn in the assignment.</p>
