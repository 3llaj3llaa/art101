					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with my partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I had a few issues getting my image to show up on the page where I wanted it to. It

						but it was nice to have a little refresher on different variables for it. </p>

						Just a little tidbit about my MX5: Her name is Cake! She is a middle-aged 1.6L moneypit 
						with mismatched panels because I haven't found the time to finish wrapping her. Someday she will be a 220 
						horsepower Eco Tec girly and will be all black with those sweet hot pink heart wheels. I love my miatata.
						Oh and heres my program execution:
