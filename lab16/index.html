					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with processing JSON from an API.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems with CORS not allowing the API to load. Instead I was able to find a solution with chatgpt by using a proxy instead. 
						However, the proxy the AI provided also did not work. I had to look up other proxys to use and ended up using
						https://api.allorigins.win/get?url= to make the API function properly.
