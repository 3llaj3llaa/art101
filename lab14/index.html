			<h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really have much to do for this lab, but I did add some debugging
					to my previous labs' code. I feel like I really understand how the basics
					 work for coding, and I am confident in my ability to be able to create simple code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You are looking at the results of my HTML file here. Take a look at the debugging section to 
						get a better idea of what I did for this lab!
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				
					<h2>Debugging</h2>
					<p>Most of the work done here will just be adding a debugging function to my previous code, 
						in order to make it pause a function and allow me or the user to take a look at the state
						 of the code to insure that everything is okay.
