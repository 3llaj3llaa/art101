			<h1>Lab 2 - Hello World</h1>
				<p> We are Sam and Ella! Ella is a 3rd year AGPM major and her favorite color is purple. Sam is an Art major and her favorite color is forest green. We both have glasses!</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a webpage with HTML. Include a header that says "Hello World" and write a paragraph about us and our partner. We then use CSS to stylize our webpage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of our problems with this lab was working with the css file.  We couldn't figure out how to edit certain things. We were able to look back through the lecture slides and some student examples to troubleshoot.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Sam and I struggled with our lack of experience with HTLM and CSS, so this was a huge learning experience for the both of us. However, we did our best by using the resources we had and helping each other with certain tasks.</p>
