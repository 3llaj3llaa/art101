			<h1>Lab 4 - Psuedocoding & Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create several pseudocode lists documenting
						high-level tasks and later creating a pseudocode-simple-computer-game in our 
						lab.js file.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had problems with formatting the pseudocode Rock-Paper-Scissors game on my webpage.
						For some reason it kept showing up way to far to the right and I had to work with my partner to ensure that
						it was on the page nicely. Additionally, we had some problems understanding what Task 2-3's example was and we asked Bing AI
						to rephrase the example into more understandable language as both Sam and I are still unfamiliar with coding vocabulary.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I feel that the assignment went pretty well. After getting over the hurtle of figuring out what examples to use for our
					lab things went smoothly. Any issues we had we discussed with our peers or utilized AI to help rephrase and explain things in a 
				different way that was more fitted for our vocabulary. Looking at some of the labs our peers have done, it has made me want to 
				add more css and style to my lab pages and homepage. </p>
