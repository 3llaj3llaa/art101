					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and 
						manipulate a string.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I had some issues with trying to figure out how to make the code sort by capitals first, but was able to 
						figure it out after messing with it for a while. I also forgot to link my js file with the proper name so I spent a 
						lot of time trying to figure out why my script wasn't showing up, but it was just a simple mistake. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I'm really happy with how this lab turned out! I had some problems doing the bonus task, but worked really hard to 
						make sure it worked well and that my page looked cute. Although after seeing what some students do in the class, I get 
						a little sad about my coding ability. But eventually I hope I can make an awesome page just like my peers.
					</p>
