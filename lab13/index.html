			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with loops. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I ran into quite a few small problems when working with the code. Most of them being capitalization errors on my part 
						when writing the factorObj's. Other than that, I didn't have too many issues with this code aside from those small errors.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I feel like I did a good job at getting this code done! I spent quite a lot of time on it. And had to refer back to the class recording a couple of times.
						Other than that, I would say things went pretty smoothly, aside from my small errors.
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You can view the results of my lab by messing with the inputs below.</p>
					
					Where should we stop? <input type = "number" min="0" max="200" id="max"><br>
					What factors should print what? <br>
