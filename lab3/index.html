			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab focused on creating neat local file structures, 
					adding additional index.html files, and using CSS to stylize our homepage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some issues imputing the actual HTML code as I was missing small things like closing brackets, semi colons and using
						colons instead of the equal sign. However, after spending more time with the code I was able to create functioning code without issues.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I worked really hard and spent a lot of extra time looking at other websites and adding additional information
						and photos to my webpage. It's still a work in progress, but I hope to be able to create a really beautiful homepage.
						Everything went fairly smoothly, however, I did have to spend a lot of extra time watching videos and reading tutorials 
						to get certain looks on my webpage. I even learned a few new functions of CSS! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You are looking at some of the results of my work! However, check out my homepage 
						you will really see my hard work there in the inspect!</p>
