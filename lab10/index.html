			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems with Task X which would keep reusing the user input I added the first time. After an hour or so I realized I needed to add a 
						new line of code that would clear the user input everytime. After that I had little to no issue with Task X or the rest of this lab. Things went by smoothly
						and I have been watching a lot of Youtube videos to better understand jQuery and JavaScript which has really made these labs easier for me. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I am extremely happy with how this lab went. I felt that this was the first time I actually understood what to do with the Bonus task! I was able to get the 
						lab done really quickly while still putting in a lot of work and effort to make sure it was clean and worked perfectly. I am really excited to try out 
						more things like this in the future. Especially with jQuery I really like using it. </p>
